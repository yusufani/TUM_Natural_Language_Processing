# My Comments:
I am interested in NLP for a long time and have a prior experience. I took a course to go deeper.

The course teach you basic NLP techniques technically. I followed the course with the book and with study group which I recommend you too.

The negative side of the course is that it is not very practical. It is more theoretical. Also contains many topics. It definitely be more than 6 credits. I think it should be 10 credits.

The exam is very interesting. It always gives directs you to think. You should completely understand the topics.


Here is topics of exam in my semester:
1. CYK and Dependency parsing - how they work
Neural approaches to both (pros/cons, mechanics)
2. What's a language model? 
Ngram language models
3. Logic - know how to make an expression from a sentence
4. Self-attention and cross-attention mechanism in detail, pros and cons of transformers, pros and cons of other encoder-decoder architectures
5. Sense embeddings (WSD) - how they work etc. 
6. Dialogue systems - generation vs. retrieval
